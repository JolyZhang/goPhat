Fuzz Testing (Work in Progress)
======

Make sure that `goPhat/vr/vr_exec.go` has been installed.

From the `fuzz_testing` directory, run the following on the command line

    go install
    fuzz_testing --path [filename]

where [filename] is the name of the file that contains the randomly generated
data to be used for the test. The first line should be the number of replicas
to create (currently only 3 works properly), and each following line should be
an integer between 0 and 20. Currently only killing a replica (&lt;10) and stopping
a replica (&lt;20) work.
